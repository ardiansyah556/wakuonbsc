# Waku Memecoin - Design Philosophy

## Design Movement
**Playful Maximalism with Crypto Energy** - A vibrant, high-energy aesthetic that celebrates the fun and irreverent nature of memecoin culture while maintaining professional credibility.

## Core Principles
1. **Energy & Vibrancy**: Bold yellows, oranges, and warm gradients that evoke excitement and movement
2. **Playful Authenticity**: Meme-style characters and humor that feel genuine, not corporate
3. **Accessibility with Personality**: Clear information hierarchy with distinctive visual flourishes
4. **Community-Centric**: Design elements celebrate the collective nature of memecoin culture

## Color Philosophy
- **Primary**: Golden Yellow (#FCD34D) - warmth, energy, wealth symbolism
- **Secondary**: Vibrant Orange (#FB923C) - excitement, action, urgency
- **Accent**: Electric Purple (#A855F7) - crypto/blockchain association
- **Neutral**: Deep Charcoal (#1F2937) - readability and contrast
- **Background**: Cream/Off-white (#FFFBEB) - approachable, not sterile

## Layout Paradigm
- **Hero Section**: Full-width with animated character carousel
- **Asymmetric Grid**: Alternating text-left/image-right sections
- **Organic Flow**: Curved dividers and diagonal transitions between sections
- **Character Showcase**: Gallery grid with hover animations
- **Social Integration**: Prominent CTAs for Twitter, Telegram, four.meme

## Signature Elements
1. **Radial Burst Background**: Yellow rays emanating from characters (consistent with burger character)
2. **Character Personalities**: Each food character has unique expression and pose
3. **Crypto Badges**: Small blockchain/coin icons scattered throughout
4. **Animated Transitions**: Smooth scroll-triggered animations

## Interaction Philosophy
- Hover effects that make elements "pop"
- Click-to-reveal character backstories
- Smooth scroll animations
- Playful micro-interactions (buttons that react to hover)

## Animation Guidelines
- Entrance animations: Fade-in + slight scale (200ms)
- Hover states: Scale 1.05 + subtle shadow increase
- Scroll animations: Parallax effects on character images
- Transitions: Cubic-bezier easing for natural motion

## Typography System
- **Display Font**: "Fredoka" (bold, friendly, modern) - Headlines
- **Body Font**: "Inter" (clean, readable) - Body text
- **Accent Font**: "Fredoka One" (ultra-bold) - Key CTAs and stats

## Chinese Language Integration
- All UI text translated to Simplified Chinese
- Maintain design hierarchy and readability with CJK characters
- Font: "Noto Sans SC" for optimal Chinese rendering
